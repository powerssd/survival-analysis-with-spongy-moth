# Survival of adult spongy moth
This R project contains the script I used to analyze how the survival of adult spongy moth changes in response to larval acclimation. This project also includes an [RMarkdown report](https://github.com/powerssd/survival-analysis-with-spongy-moth/blob/main/LD-adult-survival-analysis.html) that describes this analysis in detail.
